Step-1: Create ecr private repositories
Step-2: Name the file and create repository
Step-3: Go to settings:
           1. Create replication configuration
           2. Enable cross region replication and select region which we want to replicate
           3. Enable cross account replication and select region and account which you want to replicate
Step-4: Push the image:
          Commands to push image:
              1. Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
                    aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 --profile PROFILE_NAME | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin Account_Id.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

              2. Build your Docker image
                    docker build -f Dockerfile.txt -t dev_image .

              3. After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
                    docker tag dev_image:latest Account_Id.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev_image:latest

              4. Push this image to your newly created AWS repository
                    docker push Account_Id.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev_image:latest
